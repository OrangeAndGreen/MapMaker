Plan:
-User configures the map they want
	-Specify boundaries (county, state, etc.)
	-Specify data
	-Specify mapping from data to colors
-User presses button to generate KML file


Maps that should be generated:
-States visited
-County heat maps from census demographics data




Things to code:
-Load a KmlFile
-Create styles for the colors we're going to use (add them to the doc)
-For each region, set the style based on the desired color


Brainstorming:
There are multiple aspects to what I want to do:
	1) Draw a map given a data file
	2) Build the various data files



Drawing maps:
	Data file dictates the map
		Source (counties, states, etc.) determined by data in the file
		Coloring (binary, multi, scaled) determined by data values
			Scan the data file when selected
			If no 2nd column or only two values present >> binary
			If 



Building data files:
	Data file format:
		CSV file
		1st column: Place name
		2nd column: Place value (OPTIONAL)



Putting the UI together:
	Startup:
		Code loads and prepares the map sources (including renaming counties/districts)
	User selects a data file
	Code scans the data file and indicates type of data and available values
	User selects coloring details
		Either a color ramp or a list of colors
		For ramp, option to specify manual min and max values
	User presses Go
	Code generates the map


TODOs:
	-Create a MapSource class for holding the sources
	-Extract state codes
	-Use state codes to augment county/district names
	-Scan data file when loaded and report findings
	-Extract other info from KMLs (i.e. land area for counties/states)
	-Implement color schemes (IColorScheme interface, with AssignedColorScheme and MappedColorScheme classes)
